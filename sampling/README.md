# Sampling
Starting the main.py will start the sampling and evaluation for one event log. Event log and further paramerts can be set in the ConfigManager.py.

For multiprocessing start the multi_p.py. The same function as in the main.py will be started but with many event lgos parallel. For each event log will one process instance be started.
